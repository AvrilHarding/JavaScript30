    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let number = 100
    let number2 = number;
    console.log(number, number2);

    number = 200;
    console.log(number, number2);


    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const teams = players;
    console.log(players, teams);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // teams[3] = 'avril'; // this updates the original players array too as teams only references the array. 

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const teams2 = players.slice();  // you can now update teams2 and players will be the original array. 

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const teams3 = [].concat(players); // or like this, will make the array new in new array teams3.

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const teams4 = [...players]; // this will take every item that is iterable in array and put it in new array. 

    // or 
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap = Object.assign({}, person, { height: '5ft 5', name: 'Avril', age:30 });
    console.log(cap);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
